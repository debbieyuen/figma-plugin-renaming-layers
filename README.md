# Figma Plugin: Renaming Layers ðŸŽ‰
A Figma plugin that simplifies renaming layers and components by streamlining your refactoring process. While designing in Figma, clean up your layers by renaming duplicates and variations of a component within the same layer all at once! For example, rename all `buttons` within a parent component in one go while excluding nodes of different types such as `text`, `spacers`, and `images`.
